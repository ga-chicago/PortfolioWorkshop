- (If you have, backup your content because it will be replaced)
- Copy the contents of this repository's `jekyll-starter-kit` to your **you-username.github.io** repository.
- To test your portfolio locally, install **Jekyll**: `gem install jekyll`
- Then run `jekyll serve` in that repository directory.
- Finally, browse to your live app: `localhost:4000`
